### Data Flow Architecture

1. **Project Creation Flow**:
   - User creates project via UI → ProjectManager.add_project() → ProjectDatabase.save_project()
   - User uploads requirements → AIAssistantAgent.analyze_document() → PlanningManager.create_plan()

2. **Implementation Flow**:
   - PlanningManager.start_feature() → SlackManager.create_thread() → GitHubManager.create_branch()
   - AIAssistantAgent.generate_code_for_feature() → GitHubManager.commit_file()
   - GitHubManager.create_pull_request() → ProjectManager.handle_pr_received()

3. **Communication Flow**:
   - User message via ChatInterface → API → AIAssistantAgent.analyze_thread_message()
   - AIAssistantAgent response → SlackManager.send_message() → UI update
